                      <p>We, Ishraak Solutions(owner of the service JobXprss), a Dhaka based company with offices at House 76(Level 4), Road 4, Block B, Niketan, Dhaka 1212, Bangladesh as the data controller ("Ishraak," "we," or "us"), explain in this Privacy and Cookie Policy (the “Policy”) how we collect, process and/or use information that we receive via our websites, emails we send, and mobile applications (collectively, the "Platform") that link to this Policy, as amended from time to time. This Policy describes how Ishraakr collects, processes, uses, shares and secures the personal information you provide. It also describes your choices regarding use, access, and correction of your personal information. For purposes of this Policy, personal information shall mean any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p>
                      <p>This Policy applies only to information we collect, process and use through the Platform. This Policy does not apply to information that we collect through other channels, such as information that we collect offline, from other websites or from emails you send us.</p>
                      <h5 id="termss">Information We Collect</h5>
                      <p>We collect information about you to provide our services. In order for us to best provide our services to you (and to help make it feasible for us to do so), it is essential that we are able to collect and use the information as described in this Policy. This means that the data collection is largely necessary for fulfilling the relationship we have with you, and where that is not the case, we have a legitimate interest in collecting the information described below.</p>
{#                      <ul>#}

{#                        <li>who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure.</li>#}
{#                      </ul>#}
                      <h5 id="condition">Information You Give Us</h5>
                      <p>When you fill out registration forms, submit your resume, or provide us with other personal information actively, we collect that information for processing and use in accordance with this Policy. Because we change our offerings and features from time to time, the options you have to provide us with personal information also may change, but here are some examples of situations in which you will have the opportunity to provide personal information to us:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Creating an account;</li>
                        <li>Signing up for email alerts;</li>
                        <li>Completing a form related to one of our products or services;</li>
                        <li>Uploading a resume;</li>
                          <li>Contacting us for technical support or customer service.</li>
                      </ul></br>

                        <p>Depending on how you interact with our Platform, the personal information we collect from you may vary. For example, to create an account we may ask only for an email address and password. In other circumstances, such as when you complete a form related to a particular service offering, we may ask you to provide other information, which may include your name, phone number, and/or postal address. We also collect and store certain information associated with actions you take. When you search for jobs, we store the titles, locations and general salary range (if available) of jobs you search for and click on. We also store information about the job postings that you apply to, the time and duration of your activity on our Platform, and other information about your behavior on our Platform.</p>
                        <p>If you connect to the Platform using Facebook, linkedin, Google+, or another social networking site (each a "Social Networking Site"), we will receive information that you authorize the Social Networking Site to share with us, which may include public profile information, date of birth, current office, educational institution and email address. When we receive this information, it becomes Ishraak account information for purposes of your use of the Platform. This information also constitutes personal information and is, therefore, subject to this Policy. Any information that we collect from your Social Networking Site account may depend on the privacy settings you have set with the Social Networking Site; so, please consult the Social Networking Site's privacy and data practices. You have the ability to disconnect your Social Networking Site account from your Ishraak account by adapting the privacy settings in your Social Networking Site account. If you come to the Platform through a Social Networking Site, from other websites or with devices that enable third parties to collect information from or about you, such third parties receive information about you subject to their privacy policies.</p>
                        <p>When you set up an individual user account on the Platform, you may create a profile (a "Profile") that will include personal information you provide. At your request, we will create your Profile with information we extract from a resume you have uploaded on the Platform. When you fill out and save your Profile, your saved Profile can be viewed by prospective employers, subject to visibility settings you control. (For example, when you apply to certain <b>Easy Apply</b>  jobs posted by an Ishraak employer client, we may share a static image of your saved Profile with that employer in connection with your application). Because your anonymity on our Platform is important, your Profile does not include or link to information you submit to the Platform anonymously (for example, the reviews, salaries, benefits and company ratings information you submit anonymously).</p>
                        <p>We may host an <b>Easy Apply</b> application that asks for relevant information generally considered sensitive (such as <b>driver’s license number for a drivers job, or a government-issued identification number for a government job</b>). Some applications may ask you to identify your racial/ethnic origin or disabilities on a strictly voluntary basis (e.g. for purposes of providing <b>preferred</b> employment opportunities) and you may choose not to submit this information without any detriment to your application. <b>For our EU users, data about racial/ethnic origin and disabilities are considered special categories of personal data under Article 9 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR")</b>. When we host Easy Apply applications that collect this kind of data, we pass that information along to the employer when we submit your application and do not retain it on our systems. But please remember, you should not include this kind of data in any resume you upload to the Platform or submit it in any other  scenarios, except where we specifically prompt you to provide such information such as described above.</p>
                        <p>If you enter credit card information on the Platform in connection with a purchase, that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf.</p>
                      <p>Employers with <b>Free Employer Accounts</b> may provide us with work email addresses of their employees for use to send an email asking those employees to leave candid reviews of the employer on the Platform.</p>

{#                      <p>All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

We also use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software records information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>

                      <h5 id="third-party">How We Work with Third-Party Advertisement Partners</h5>
                      <p>When we work with our Advertisement Partners to serve you personalized, interest-based advertising, we do not share information with them that they can use to identify you or associate with you as a specific individual unless you have instructed us to do so (such as when you fill out a lead form in an ad, or approve your Profile for display to employers). Similarly, if one of these Ad Partners have information about you saved in one of their own Cookies on your browser, they use that information to help us send you a relevant advertisement, but they do not share with us information that we can associate with you as an individual.</p>
                      <p>We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Ishraak generally. We have also implemented <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2799357?hl=en"><b style="color:blue;">Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</b></a>, which categorizes Cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Platform and various websites across the internet. In addition, a Cookie on some of our employer clients sites provides us with aggregate data about the number of applications submitted to those sites by users of Platform.</p>
                      <h5 id="opting-out">Opting Out of Cookies</h5>
                      <p><b>Ishraak Cookies</b>. We use Cookies that are necessary for us to provide the services you use and you cannot opt out of these Cookies on the Platform.

In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network; rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push ads through to users located in certain areas. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Ishraak native app settings.</p>
